# babyOS

My first go at a very simple operating system created from the ground up. This OS is going to closely follow Daniel McCarthy's peachOS that he covers in his books on building an OS. That said, my goal for this project is to create my own version of it given my previous knowledge and doing my own research, only referencing his material when I'm stuck or lost.

## Features

- Everything is written from scratch (even the bootloader)
    - Now that I'm thinking about it... this is probably an anti-feature... oh well :)
- TBD...
